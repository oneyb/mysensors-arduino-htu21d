* A simple, inexpensive DIY temperature sensor
A wireless, battery-powered thermo- and hygrometer based on the Arduino Mega2560 + HTU21D + MySensors + Platformio.
  - *NOTE*: the Arduino Mega2560 is overkill for this application and consumes too much power for this setup.
 
This is what it could look like on your [[https://www.home-assistant.io/][hassbian (Home Assistant)]] [[https://www.mysensors.org/build/raspberry][controller]].

See:
  - https://www.mysensors.org/build/raspberry
  - https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/hassbian/installation/

* Getting it working

  - clone this repository and enter the directory
  - get everything wired up
  - install platformio and any possible dependencies
    - consider this ansible playbook: https://github.com/oneyb/rpi-ap-ha/blob/master/install-platformio.yaml
    - or make sure it works with the proper required packages
      - ~virtualenv test && source test/bin/activate && pip install -r pip-requirements.txt~
  - Compile and upload firmware (assuming you have the [[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/faq.html#faq-udev-rules][udev rules]] set up and a USB plugged in with an upload_port of ~/dev/ttyACM0~):
    - ~pio run -t upload~
  - Check the output of your sensor on you MySensors gateway+controller
  - Be happy if it works. Accept the challenge if it doesn't ;).

* Parts list

  - Arduino Mega2560
  - NRF24L01+ radio
  - HTU21D
  - Dupont cables, breadboard, soldering stuff, coffee

* Wiring 
The following is just very simple but should tell you what needs to be hooked up where. Bothe the radio, and thermo- and hygrometer are 3.3V. Therefore, supplying the correct voltage will keep your boards from breaking :).

* Planned improvements
  - Decrease power consumption by employing an Arduino mini pro
  - make Fritzing wiring diagram
  - measure power usage
  - have code recognize and adjust pin numbers according to board
